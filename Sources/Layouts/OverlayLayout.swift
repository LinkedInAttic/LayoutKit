 A layout that overlays others. Allows adding other layouts behind or above one or more primary layouts.
 The size of the primary, background, and overlay layouts will be determined based on the size
 computed from the primary layouts, which takes the maximum width and height of all primary layouts.
 The primary layouts will be stacked on top of each other in the same order as they are in the passed
 in array, with the first primary layout in the array being at the bottom. Background layouts and overlay
 layouts are stacked in the same fashion. Primary layouts are behind all overlay layouts and above all
