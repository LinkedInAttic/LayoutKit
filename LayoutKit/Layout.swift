/**
 A protocol for types that layout view frames.
 
 ### Basic layouts

 Many UIs can be expressed by composing the basic layouts that LayoutKit provides:

 - `LabelLayout`
 - `InsetLayout`
 - `SizeLayout`
 - `StackLayout`
 
 If your UI can not be expressed by composing these basic layouts,
 then you can create a custom layout that implements the `Layout` protocol.

 ### Layout algorithm

 Layout is performed in two steps:

   1. `measurement(within:)`
   2. `arrangement(within:measurement:)`.

 `arrangement(origin:width:height:)` is a convenience method for doing both passes in one function call.

 ### Threading

 Layouts MUST be thread-safe.

    /**
     Measures the minimum size of the layout and its sublayouts.

     It MAY be run on a background thread.
     
     - parameter maxSize: The maximum size available to the layout.
     - returns: The minimum size required by the layout and its sublayouts given a maximum size.
     The size of the layout MUST NOT exceed `maxSize`.

    func measurement(within maxSize: CGSize) -> LayoutMeasurement

    /**
     Returns the arrangement of frames for the layout inside a given rect.
     The frames SHOULD NOT overflow rect, otherwise they may overlap with adjacent layouts.

     The layout MAY choose to not use the entire rect (and instead align itself in some way inside of the rect),
     but the caller SHOULD NOT reallocate unused space to other layouts because this could break the layout's desired alignment and padding.
     Space allocation SHOULD happen during the measure pass.

     MAY be run on a background thread.
     
     - parameter rect: The rectangle that the layout must position itself in.
     - parameter measurement: A measurement which has size less than or equal to `rect.size` and greater than or equal to `measurement.maxSize`.
     - returns: A complete set of frames for the layout.

     The flexibility of the layout.

     If a layout has a single sublayout, it SHOULD inherit the flexiblity of its sublayout.
     If a layout has no sublayouts (e.g. LabelLayout), it SHOULD allow its flexibility to be configured.
     All layouts SHOULD provide a default flexiblity.
