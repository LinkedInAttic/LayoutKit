/**
 The flexibility of a layout along both dimensions.
 
 Flexibility is a hint to a layout's parent about how the parent should prioritize space allocation among its children
 when there is either insufficient or too much space.
 
 A layout MAY use the flexibility of its sublayouts to determine how to allocate its available space between those sublayouts.
 A layout SHOULD NOT ever need to inspect its own flexiblity.

 A parent layout MAY compress ANY sublayout (even sublayouts that are configured as inflexible) if there is insufficient space.
 A parent layout MAY expand any flexible sublayout if there is excess space and if the parent layout wants to fill that space.
 A parent layout SHOULD favor expanding/compressing more flexible sublayouts over less flexible sublayouts.
 A parent layout SHOULD NOT expand inflexible sublayouts.
